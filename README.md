The Odin Project Landing Page

Welcome to my second TOP project. The purpose of this project is to create
and style a webpage using HTML and CSS. Going from a plain un-styled HTML
file to a beautiful page with nice backgrounds and cool spacing. I'm expecting
to make use of flexbox in both column and row directions, with the help of
some divs to create containers.
